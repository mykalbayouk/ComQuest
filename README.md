# Community Quest
## Inspiration
We were inspired by other apps that allow people to be contracted for a job like Doordash or Uber. The way that people connect on our app is also similar to an app like Facebook Marketplace as our users can get connected with local community members for help.
## What it does
Our app has two kinds of users. Heroes and civilians. Heroes are able to input their skills and qualifications that could help others. Civilians can then select from a list of options the kind of help that they need. Both groups will then be able to view the requests or availability from the other side and select a quest/ hero that they like. The heroes will then be given all of the quest's information and can then go save the civilian!
## How we built it
We built an Android app using Android Studio. 
## Challenges we ran into
Our first main challenge was getting a hang of Android Studio as only one member of the group had experience with it. However he helped everyone out and we all learned the platform. We also had problems using GitHub and getting everybody synced together within the Android Studio platform.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the speed in which we built the project it took us about 14 hours of total work. Also, the project is a functioning Android app with a good user interface.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about mobile app development and also got very comfortable with using GitHub push and pull requests.
## What's next for CommunityQuest
Our project's next step would be to get a proper database set up to keep user's information.
